## Some Questions and Answers :thinking:

* What is the purpose of this repository? What is the reason behind it?
    * I want to record my journey and what I’ve learned, and this also includes many reasons in it. Like many people, I also learned many things in my past, but didn’t record them and didn’t do a recall to myself as I should have. This caused a situation where I’m learning the same things many times. This situation is absurdly painful and, in a way, intolerable. I want to hold strongly to what I’ve learned and not let it slip through my hands that easily, and this is the most important main reason. Some other reasons are: I have a desire for content creation, and I want to have proof of the things I know, because especially in the age of AI, many people pretend to know even the things they don’t really know. Yeah, I really believe that it is important, and it will become even more important to be able to show your work and provide proof of your skills.
